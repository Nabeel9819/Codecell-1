	- Removed dependency from Accounts/home.html to Accounts/base.html
		- base.html contains the link rel stylesheet cdn links and static links
		- important to add two tags for all other html files to import those
	- Removed bug - login redirect url used to trail home page and hence lead to inconsistent url pattern
